# AVR Embedded Systems Projects

This repository contains multiple AVR microcontroller projects demonstrating keypad input handling, LCD interfacing, motor control, and basic embedded system functionalities.

## Projects Included

### 1. Keypad-Based Password System  
- Secure 4-digit password entry via keypad  
- Feedback shown on LCD with custom characters  
- Controls output pins based on password correctness  
- Lockout after multiple incorrect attempts

### 2. DC Motor Direction Control  
- Controls DC motor direction (forward, reverse, left, right)  
- Uses input pins to determine motor state  
- Outputs signals to motor driver pins accordingly

### 3. Keypad Calculator  
- Basic calculator using keypad and LCD  
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Displays result on LCD  
- Clears display on user command

## Technologies Used

- AVR Microcontroller (ATmega series)  
- Embedded C programming  
- LCD (16x2) interface  
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad interface  
- GPIO pin control

## How to Use

- Clone the repository  
- Open each project folder  
- Compile using AVR GCC or Atmel Studio  
- Upload to target AVR microcontroller  
- Connect peripherals (LCD, keypad, motor driver) as per project schematic
